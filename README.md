# LostGet

## Introduction

LostGet is a smartphone application that allows users to report their lost, found items all in one spot. There exists no efficient system to cope with this issue of reporting lost or found items. This proposal seeks to deliver effective and efficient answers to the concerns of rising lost items and to allow users to report the items they found. 

It provides a user-friendly platform along with utilizing advancedÂ artificial intelligence techniques, using location-based services, and image recognition, the LostGet application efficiently locates and recovers lost, or found items. Moreover, the System uses big data to train machine learning algorithms to become better at predicting categories and recommending reported items their users prefer. Furthermore, to facilitate item recovery, the application employs AI-based image and description matching. When a match is found between lost and found items, notifications are sent to both the found item reporter and the lost item reporter, connecting the relevant parties for item retrieval. Our solution also has a built-in chat box, which allows users to connect more effectively using the app's messenger as well as a profanity filter that uses a machine learning-based method to automatically recognize and restrict inappropriate words. The LostGet application can transform how the public reports their lost and found items.
